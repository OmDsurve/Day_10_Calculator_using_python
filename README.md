# Day_10_Calculator_using_python
I built a Python calculator that supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can continue calculations with the result of the previous operation or start a new calculation at any time. The program uses a dictionary to map operation symbols to functions, making it easy to expand or modify.
